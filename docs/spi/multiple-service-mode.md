# Glaciion Multiple-Service Mode

```text
If multiple implementations are required, select the multiple-service mode.
You will notice that the annotation on the interface class is @MultipleServiceInterface.
It will load which implementations based on the enable(+) and disable(-) sign in the definition file.
The service loader can get an instance by name or a list of all instances (sorted by priority).
```

## Service caller site

### 1.Write interface class

```text
package sample;

@MultipleServiceInterface
public interface SampleMultipleService {

    String method();
    
}
```

### 2.Declare in definition file

* Edit file `META-INF/glaciion/interfaces`
* Add a line:

```text
sample.SampleMultipleService
```

### 3.Get the service instances

* Load service
* If there is a problem with the definition file / interface class / implementation class, an exception will be thrown.
* [Preloading](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/preload.md) will be triggered at the first 
time you load a service. The premise is in the `Spring` environment, or the VM option `-Dglaciion.conf.preload.auto=true` is set

```text
//Use the default classloader
MultipleServiceLoader<SampleMultipleService> loader = Glaciion.loadMultipleService(SampleMultipleService.class);

//Use the specified classloader
//MultipleServiceLoader<SampleMultipleService> loader = Glaciion.loadMultipleService(SampleMultipleService.class, classloader);
```

* Get service instances
* If the instantiation fails, an exception will be thrown

```text
//Get by name
SampleMultipleService instance = loader.get("name");

//Get all (Sort by implementation priority, the higher the priority value, the higher the priority, the 0th has the highest priority)
List<SampleMultipleService> instances = loader.getAll();
```

* `WARNING! Service loaders created by different class loaders are not the same, and the service instances they get are not the same!`
* `Glaciion only guarantees that the service loaders generated by the same class loader are the same. The service instances created by the same service loader are the same. If you create a service loader with different class loaders, the service instances are not the same.`
* `The service instances in the following cases may be different:`

```text
class A {
    void method1(){
        //Instance1 is not necessarily the same instance as instance2, because the classloader in current may be different, so the service loader may be different
        SampleMultipleService instance1 = Glaciion.loadMultipleService(SampleMultipleService.class).get("name");
    }
}
class B {
    void method2(){
        //Instance1 is not necessarily the same instance as instance2, because the classloader in current may be different, so the service loader may be different
        SampleMultipleService instance2 = Glaciion.loadMultipleService(SampleMultipleService.class).get("name");
    }
}
```

## Service Provider site

### 1.Write implementation class

```text
package sample;

//Name, Optional, Cannot get by name without setting it
@ImplementationName("name")
//Priority, Optional, 0 by default, The higher the priority value, the higher the priority, the 0th has the highest priority
@ImplementationPriority(1)
public class SampleMultipleServiceImpl1 implements SampleMultipleService {

    @Override
    public String method() {
        //TO DO logic
    }
    
}
```

* You can inject properties to implementation instance, See [Property Inject](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/property-injection.md)
* Implementation classes can listen for their own creation and closing events, 
See [Implementation Lifecycle](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/implementation-lifecycle.md)
* `TIPS: When the implementation name is repeated, only one can be obtained by name, and the others can only be obtained by getAll.`
* `TIPS: When the implementation priorities are the same, sort according to the hash of the implementation class name`

### 2.Declare in definition file

* Edit file `META-INF/glaciion/services/multiple/sample.SampleMultipleService`
* Contents:

```text
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl2
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl3
```

* Definition file path: META-INF/glaciion/services/multiple/`interface-classname`
* Definition file contents: +`implementation-classname`

<br>

## Plug and unplug mechanism

* In multiple-service mode, we can load multiple implementations
* In the definition file, there are two commands, enabled(+) and disabled(-)
* Enable(+) and disable(-) commands have different levels, +/- is level 1, ++/-- is level 2, +++/--- is level 3 ... (No length limit)
* If the levels are the same, the disable's priority is higher than the enable's
* VM option have the highest priority (glaciion.delete)

```text
The logic to determine if an implementation is enabled is to see the highest level of commands, disable if there is a `-`, 
enable if all are '+'. In actual use, if you want to enable an implementation, you need to add a higher level enable 
command. If you want to disable one, just add a disable command with the same level as the highest level.
```

### Example

* Definition file path: META-INF/glaciion/services/multiple/`interface-classname`

#### In the following examples, the service is finally enabled

* Highest level is 1, and there is only one '+', service enabled

```text
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
```

* Highest level is 2, and there is only one '++', service enabled

```text
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
-sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
++sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
```

#### In the following examples, the service is finally disabled

* Highest level is 1, and there is a '-', service disabled

```text
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
-sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
```

* Highest level is 2, and there is a '--', service disabled

```text
+sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
-sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
++sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
--sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1
```

### Force delete implementation by VM option

* Add VM option: -Dglaciion.remove.`interface-classname`=`implementation-classname`,`implementation-classname`
* For example:

```text
-Dglaciion.remove.sample.SampleMultipleService=sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl1,sample.SampleMultipleServiceImpl2
```
