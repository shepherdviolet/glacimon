# Glaciion Single-Service Mode

```text
If only one implementation is required, select the single-service mode.
You will notice that the annotation on the interface class is @SingleServiceInterface.
It will load which implementation based on the priority in the definition file.
```

## Service caller site

### 1.Write interface class

```text
package sample;

@SingleServiceInterface
public interface SampleSingleService {

    String method();
    
}
```

### 2.Declare in definition file

* Edit file `META-INF/glaciion/interfaces`
* Add a line:

```text
sample.SampleSingleService
```

### 3.Get the service instances

* Load service
* If there is a problem with the definition file / interface class / implementation class, an exception will be thrown.
* [Preloading](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/preload.md) will be triggered at the first 
time you load a service. The premise is in the `Spring` environment, or the VM option `-Dglaciion.conf.preload.auto=true` is set

```text
//Use the default classloader
SingleServiceLoader<SampleSingleService> loader = Glaciion.loadSingleService(SampleSingleService.class);

//Use the specified classloader
//SingleServiceLoader<SampleSingleService> loader = Glaciion.loadSingleService(SampleSingleService.class, classloader);
```

* Get service instances
* If the instantiation fails, an exception will be thrown

```text
SampleSingleService instance = loader.get();
```

* `WARNING! Service loaders created by different class loaders are not the same, and the service instances they get are not the same!`
* `Glaciion only guarantees that the service loaders generated by the same class loader are the same. The service instances created by the same service loader are the same. If you create a service loader with different class loaders, the service instances are not the same.`
* `The service instances in the following cases may be different:`

```text
class A {
    void method1(){
        //Instance1 is not necessarily the same instance as instance2, because the classloader in current may be different, so the service loader may be different
        SampleSingleService instance1 = Glaciion.loadSingleService(SampleSingleService.class).get();
    }
}
class B {
    void method2(){
        //Instance1 is not necessarily the same instance as instance2, because the classloader in current may be different, so the service loader may be different
        SampleSingleService instance2 = Glaciion.loadSingleService(SampleSingleService.class).get();
    }
}
```

## Service Provider site

### 1.Write implementation class

```text
package sample;

public class SampleSingleServiceImpl implements SampleSingleService {

    @Override
    public String method() {
        //TO DO logic
    }
    
}
```

* You can inject properties to implementation instance, See [Property Inject](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/property-injection.md)
* Implementation classes can listen for their own creation and closing events, 
See [Implementation Lifecycle](https://github.com/shepherdviolet/glaciion/blob/master/docs/implementation-lifecycle.md)

### 2.Declare in definition file

* Edit file `META-INF/glaciion/services/single/sample.SampleSingleService`
* Contents:

```text
sample.SampleSingleServiceImpl
```

* Definition file path: META-INF/glaciion/services/single/`interface-classname`
* Definition file contents (Default priority): `implementation-classname`
* Definition file contents (Custom priority): `implementation-classname` `priority`

<br>

## Selection mechanism

* In single-service mode, only one implementation will be loaded
* You can adjust the priority of the implementation in the definition file
* The higher the priority value, the higher the priority, the highest priority implementation will be loaded. the default will be 0 if not set.
* VM option have the highest priority (glaciion.select)
* `TIPS: When there is more than one implementation with the highest priority, which one is loaded according to the hash 
of the implementation class name`

### How to set priority

* Definition file path: META-INF/glaciion/services/single/`interface-classname`
* Definition file contents: `implementation-classname` `priority`

* For example, the priority of sample.SampleSingleServiceImpl is 1

```text
sample.SampleSingleServiceImpl 1
```

* You can increase the priority of implementation by declaring a higher priority definition repeatedly

### Force select the implementation by VM option

* Add VM option: -Dglaciion.select.`interface-classname`=`implementation-classname`
* For example:

```text
-Dglaciion.select.sample.SampleSingleService=sample.SampleSingleServiceImpl
```
